LitJSON for Unity Package Manager (UPM)
=======================================

A *.Net* library to handle conversions from and to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) strings, modified for the Unity3D engine's Package Manager format.

> _It's quick and lean, without external dependencies.
> Just a few classes so easily embeddable in your own code or a very small assembly to ship with your code.
> The code is highly portable, which in general makes it easy to adapt for new platforms._
